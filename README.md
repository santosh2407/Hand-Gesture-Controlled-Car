# Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Car
In this project, I have introduced a hand-gesture-based control interface for navigating a car-robot. A 3-axis accelerometer is adopted to record a userâ€™s hand trajectories. The trajectory data is transmitted wirelessly via an RF module to a computer. The received trajectories are then classified to one of six control commands for navigating a car-robot. The classifier adopts the dynamic time warping (DTW) algorithm to classify hand trajectories. Simulation results show that the classifier could achieve 92.2% correct rate.
